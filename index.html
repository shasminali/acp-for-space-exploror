                    Cats are small, carnivorous mammals that are often kept as pets. They are known for their agility,
                    independence, and playful behavior. Cats have been domesticated for thousands of years and are one
                    of the most popular pets worldwide. They come in a variety of breeds, each with its own unique
                    characteristics and appearance. Cats are also known for their grooming habits, using their tongues
                    to clean their fur and keep themselves tidy. Additionally, cats have excellent night vision and a
                    keen sense of hearing, making them skilled hunters.
